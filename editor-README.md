# How to use the editor

* Write in the editor
* click the "DO" Button
* The content of the editor will be DOne in the Rebol console, Feedback is very limited at the moment.

# Getting text into the editor

* you can use EDIT in the console, with text!, binary or url! where binary is converted to text!n and url!s are read, if they are cors-enabled.

# Example

Now press "DO" and then enter text<RETURN> in the Ren-C Console.

# Known problems

* there seem to be some race conditions on startup
* it would be nice to get a better return value on DO
